## Notebook Overview

### Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning)

The logistic regression notebook demonstrates a complete supervised learning pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation. Standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix are used to interpret model performance. This notebook builds a strong foundation in classical machine learning classification techniques using scikit-learn.

### MLP Classifier (Deep Learning)

The MLP classifier notebook introduces neural network–based classification using a Multi-Layer Perceptron. It covers feature scaling, train–test splitting, model training, and performance evaluation using classification metrics. This notebook highlights how deep learning models differ from traditional ML approaches in capturing complex data patterns.

---

## Technologies Used

Python and Jupyter Notebook are used as the development environment, with NumPy and Pandas for data handling, Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization support.

---

## Setup & Execution

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing dependencies, launch Jupyter Notebook and run the notebooks individually to explore the implementations.

---

## Highlights

The repository follows clean ML practices, maintains a clear separation between supervised and deep learning concepts, and avoids unnecessary files. The notebooks are beginner-friendly while still demonstrating interview-relevant workflows and evaluation strategies.
